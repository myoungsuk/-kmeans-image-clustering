# K-Means Image Compression and Color Palette Extraction

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm to image compression and color palette extraction.

## Overview

The K-Means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised learning technique used to partition data points into K distinct groups based on their similarity. In this project, we apply the K-Means algorithm to compress an image by reducing the number of unique colors while preserving its visual quality. Additionally, the algorithm is employed to extract a representative color palette from the image.

## Dependencies

To run the script, you will need the following Python libraries:
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- scikit-learn
- SciPy
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using `pip`:


## Usage

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Place the image you want to process in the project directory and replace the `image_path` variable in the script with the path to your image.

```python
image_path = "/path/to/your/image.jpg"

python kmeans_image_compression.py

n_clusters = 5


This version should now display correctly as a README.md file on GitHub with proper Markdown formatting.
